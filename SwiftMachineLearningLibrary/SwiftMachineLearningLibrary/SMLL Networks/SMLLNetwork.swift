     Calculates the network's output for a given input.
     - Parameters:
        - input: Values for the input neurons of the network which should be fed through the network. Must be a column-vector with dimension matching number of neurons in the input layer.
     - Returns: Values for the output neurons of the network. Returned as column-vector with dimension matching number of neurons in the output layer.

     Trains the network using a given training set which will be divided into mini batches of the given size. Given an optional test set, the network's performance on this set is logged after each epoch.

        - trainingSet: Set of samples with each consisting of the input which the network should predict and the corresponding desired output.
        - numberOfEpochs: Number of full iterations over the training set.
        - miniBatchSize: Number of samples in each mini batch.
